### Presentation
My name is Desirée Skönneberg and I am a .NET developer student at IT-Högskolan i Gothenburg.   
I'm currently learning C#, webb-development, API- and database management, among other fun skills! 

### About me
I live in Mölnlycke, sharing an apartment with my brother. My boyfriend lives in London, so I visit there as often as I can. In my free-time I am a community managager/artist for my boyfriends streaming community. 
I have a teachers degree, and before my studies to become a full time developer I worked in management and project leading.
